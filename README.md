This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

# Decyde
Decyde is a project I began as a solution to the issue of picking movies for a movie night with friends. The goal is to allow groups to form and for each use to be able to star and rank movies on their own and then promote movies for movie night within a specific group.

### Current Functionality
- You are able to login to your own account
- You can search for movies using a third party movie api
- You can star movies to save them as favorites
- You can view your favorited moves and "unfavorite" them
- You can create groups

### Roadmap
- Invite friends to a group
- See a combined ranked movie list amongst the group, ordered by most voted for/highest ranking to make picking easier
- Add the ability for more in depth ranking
- Add a flag for what has been watched or vetoed to show a history of when movies were watched
- Lookup which streaming apps contain the chosen movie and link to it for ease of watching

This project is a passion/hobby project and a work in progress.
